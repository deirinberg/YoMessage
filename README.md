YoMessage
=========

YoMessage is an iOS app that allows you to send push notifications from any username through the native [Yo](http://www.justyo.co/) app. Send short messages or fake a Yo from another user.

The app is supported by another Github project, [yoforme](https://github.com/tec27/yoforme), and is supported by its [API](http://yofor.me/).
